Prerequisites: Install NAudio, an open-source .NET library written by Mark Heath. After that, see [this tutorial](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/blob/master/Docs/RecordWavFileWinFormsWaveIn.md), figure it out and implement the code. Our code will be based on that. 

Now you have a WinForm app where you can record audio to a WAV file. Now we want to add a feature to allow us to test the mic before we start recording. We'll add a real-time volume level meter to our app.

First let's define a `isRecording` flag right after the `closing` flag.

```c#
bool closing = false;
bool isRecording = false;
```

Now let's add a `Test mic` button, and a progress bar which serves as our volume meter, right after the existing buttons.

```c#
var buttonTest = new Button() { Text = "Test mic", Top = buttonStop.Bottom };
var volume = new ProgressBar(){ Top = buttonTest.Bottom, Size = new Size(800,20) };
```

Then we'll modify some event handlers. When we click `Test mic` button, we want the recording starts but we don't want the audio to be saved.  After we click `Record` button, we set `isRecording` to be true.

```c#
buttonTest.Click += (s, a) => { waveIn.StartRecording();};
buttonRecord.Click += (s, a) =>
{
	writer = new WaveFileWriter(outputFilePath, waveIn.WaveFormat);
	isRecording = true;
	buttonRecord.Enabled = false;
	buttonStop.Enabled = true;
};
```

 The recorded audio samples are represented as a byte array. Each sample is 16bit integer, so we need to convert every two array items into a sample. We calculate a max value in every buffer to represent the volume value in that period of time.

```c#
waveIn.DataAvailable += (s, a) =>
{
	if (isRecording)
	{
		writer.Write(a.Buffer, 0, a.BytesRecorded);
		// Limit the length to 30s.
		if (writer.Position > waveIn.WaveFormat.AverageBytesPerSecond * 30)
		{
         	waveIn.StopRecording();
         }
     }
	float max = 0;
	for (int index = 0; index < a.BytesRecorded; index += 2)
	{
		short sample = (short)((a.Buffer[index + 1] << 8) | a.Buffer[index + 0]);
		// to floating point
		var sample32 = sample / 32768f;
		// absolute value 
		if (sample32 < 0) sample32 = -sample32;
		// is this the max value?
		if (sample32 > max) max = sample32;
     }
	volume.Value = (int) (100*max);
};         
```
This is what our simple app looks like:
